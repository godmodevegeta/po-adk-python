Agent definition — the only file you need to edit to build your own agent.

To customise:
  • Change model, description, and instruction below.
  • Add or remove tools from the tools=[...] list.
  • Write new tool functions in the tools/ package (see tools/__init__.py).
  • Swap out the before_model_callback if you need a different context hook.
